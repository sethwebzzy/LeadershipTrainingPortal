Website Design & Development Brief for Leadership JOYCEP Training College
Overview:
We are developing a complete website (frontend + backend) for Leadership JOYCEP Training College, a health and wellness education institution located in Kitengela, Kenya. The website will function like a full university site (e.g., Grand Valley State University), with a custom landing page, course listings, intake info, service descriptions, contact forms, and more. The final site will be live on a custom domain (e.g., leadershipjoycepcollege.com).
Core Objectives:
Build a professional, responsive website that reflects the college's identity.
